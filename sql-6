Hands-on Lab: Committing and Rolling back a Transaction using a Stored Procedure in MySQL using phpMyAdmin
Estimated time needed: 20 minutes

In this lab, you will learn how to create tables and load data in the MySQL database service using the phpMyAdmin graphical user interface (GUI) tool.

Software Used in this Lab
In this lab, you will use MySQL. MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve data.


To complete this lab you will utilize MySQL relational database service available as part of IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs) Cloud IDE. SN Labs is a virtual lab environment used in this course.

Database Used in this Lab
Mysql_learners database has been used in this lab.

A transaction is simply a sequence of operations performed using one or more SQL statements as a single logical unit of work. A database transaction must be ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable). The effects of all the SQL statements in a transaction can either be applied to the database using the COMMIT command or undone from the database using the ROLLBACK command.

In this lab, you will learn some commonly used TCL (Transaction Control Language) commands of SQL through the creation of a stored procedure routine. You will learn about COMMIT, which is used to permanently save the changes done in the transactions in a table, and about ROLLBACK, which is used to undo the transactions that have not been saved in a table. ROLLBACK can only be used to undo the changes in the current unit of work.

Data Used in this Lab
The data used in this lab is internal data. You will be working on the BankAccounts and ShoeShop tables.

This lab requires you to have the BankAccounts and ShoeShop tables populated with sample data on Db2. Download the BankAccounts-CREATE.sql and ShoeShop-CREATE.sqlscripts below, upload them to the Db2 console and run them. The scripts will create new tables called BankAccounts and ShoeShop while dropping any previous BankAccounts and ShoeShop tables if they exist, and will populate them with the sample data required for this lab.

BankAccounts-CREATE.sql
ShoeShop-CREATE.sql
Please go through the lab below to learn how to upload and run a script on mysal phpadmin console (for this case, you need don't need to know anything else other than how to upload and run a script):

Hands-on Lab : Create tables using SQL scripts and load data into tables

Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Permanently save the changes done in a transaction
Undo the transaction that has not been saved

Task A: Example exercise
Let us go through an example on committing and rolling back a transaction

Make sure you have created and populated the BankAccounts and ShoeShop tables by following the "Data Used in this Lab" section of this lab.

You will create a stored procedure routine named TRANSACTION_ROSE which will include TCL commands like COMMIT and ROLLBACK.
Now develop the routine based on the given scenario to execute a transaction.
Scenario: Let's buy Rose a pair of Boots from ShoeShop. So we have to update the Rose balance as well as the ShoeShop balance in the BankAccounts table. Then we also have to update Boots stock in the ShoeShop table. After Boots, let's also attempt to buy Rose a pair of Trainers.
To create the stored procedure routine on Db2, copy the code below and paste it to the textarea of the SQL page. Click Go.

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE TRANSACTION_ROSE()

BEGIN
  
   DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
   BEGIN
       ROLLBACK;
       RESIGNAL;
   END;                
     
     START TRANSACTION;
       UPDATE BankAccounts
       SET Balance = Balance-200
       WHERE AccountName = 'Rose';
       
       UPDATE BankAccounts
       SET Balance = Balance+200
       WHERE AccountName = 'Shoe Shop';
       
       UPDATE ShoeShop
       SET Stock = Stock-1
       WHERE Product = 'Boots';
       
       UPDATE BankAccounts
       SET Balance = Balance-300
       WHERE AccountName = 'Rose';

       
       
       COMMIT;    
   
END //

DELIMITER ; 
Let's now check if the transaction can successfully be committed or not. Copy the code below in a new blank script and paste it to the textarea of the SQL page. Click Go
    CALL TRANSACTION_ROSE; 

    SELECT * FROM BankAccounts;

    SELECT * FROM ShoeShop;

We can observe that the transaction has been executed. But when we observe the tables, no changes have permanently been saved through COMMIT. All the possible changes happened might have been undone through ROLLBACK since the whole transaction fails due to the failure of a SQL statement or more. Let's go through the possible reason behind the failure of the transaction and how COMMIT - ROLLBACK works on a stored procedure:

The first three UPDATEs should run successfully. Both the balance of Rose and ShoeShop should have been updated in the BankAccounts table. The current balance of Rose should stand at 300 - 200 (price of a pair of Boots) = 100. The current balance of ShoeShop should stand at 124200 + 200 = 124400. The stock of Boots should also be updated in the ShoeShop table after the successful purchase for Rose, 11 - 1 = 10.

The last UPDATE statement tries to buy Rose a pair of Trainers, but her balance becomes insufficient (Current balance of Rose: 100 < Price of Trainers: 300) after buying a pair of Boots. So, the last UPDATE statement fails. Since the whole transaction fails if any of the SQL statements fail, the transaction won't be committed.

Task B: Practice exercise
Now let's practice an exercise on committing and rolling back a transaction.

Problem:

Create a stored procedure TRANSACTION_JAMES to execute a transaction based on the following scenario: First buy James 4 pairs of Trainers from ShoeShop. Update his balance as well as the balance of ShoeShop. Also, update the stock of Trainers at ShoeShop. Then attempt to buy James a pair of Brogues from ShoeShop. If any of the UPDATE statements fail, the whole transaction fails. You will roll back the transaction. Commit the transaction only if the whole transaction is successful.

Solution

CREATE PROCEDURE TRANSACTION_JAMES()                         



BEGIN

      
   
	DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
        ROLLBACK;
        RESIGNAL;
    END;           
        START TRANSACTION;
        UPDATE BankAccounts
        SET Balance = Balance-1200
        WHERE AccountName = 'James';
        
        UPDATE BankAccounts
        SET Balance = Balance+1200
        WHERE AccountName = 'Shoe Shop';
        
        UPDATE ShoeShop
        SET Stock = Stock-4
        WHERE Product = 'Trainers';
        
        UPDATE BankAccounts
        SET Balance = Balance-150
        WHERE AccountName = 'James';

        
        
            COMMIT;
        
       
        
END //
