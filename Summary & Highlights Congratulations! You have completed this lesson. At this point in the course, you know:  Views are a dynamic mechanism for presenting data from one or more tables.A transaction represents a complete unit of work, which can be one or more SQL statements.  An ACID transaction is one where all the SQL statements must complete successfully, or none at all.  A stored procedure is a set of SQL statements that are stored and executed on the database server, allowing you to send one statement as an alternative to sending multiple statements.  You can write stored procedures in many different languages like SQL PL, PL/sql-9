Hands-on Lab: Working with Joins in MySQL using phpMyAdmin
Estimated time needed: 20 minutes

In this lab, you will learn how to create tables and load data in the MySQL database service using the phpMyAdmin graphical user interface (GUI) tool.

Software Used in this Lab
In this lab, you will use MySQL. MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve data.


To complete this lab you will utilize MySQL relational database service available as part of IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs) Cloud IDE. SN Labs is a virtual lab environment used in this course.

Database Used in this Lab
The database used in this lab is an internal database. You will be working on a sample HR database. This HR database schema consists of 5 tables called EMPLOYEES, JOB_HISTORY, JOBS, DEPARTMENTS and LOCATIONS. Each table has a few rows of sample data. The following diagram shows the tables for the HR database:


In this lab, you will run through some SQL practice problems that will provide hands-on experience with the different kinds of join operations.


How does a CROSS JOIN (also known as Cartesian Join) statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;

How does an INNER JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
WHERE condition;

How does a LEFT OUTER JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

How does a RIGHT OUTER JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

How does a FULL OUTER JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT  OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition

UNION

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT  OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition
Union operator

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns The columns must also have similar data types The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;


How does a SELF JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
